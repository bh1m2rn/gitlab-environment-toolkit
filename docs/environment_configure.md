With [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) you can automatically configure provisioned machines.

The Toolkit provides multiple curated [Ansible Playbooks and Roles](../ansible) that will install and configure GitLab as per the [Reference Architectures](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/).

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview

Installing and configuring GitLab automatically is the most involved part of the process, as such Ansible is the most involved part of the Toolkit as a result. It's worth highlighting then how it works at a high level before we detail the steps on how to setup and use it.

### Playbooks and Roles

In a nutshell Ansible runs through the Toolkit's provided Playbooks. We have a runner Playbook, `all.yml` that runs through the rest in the correct order for GitLab. Each [Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html) in turn runs the associated [Role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) on the intended machines.

Each Role in the Toolkit is designed to be as simple as possible and match what's recommended in the GitLab docs as much as possible. They will generally run through the following steps:

1. Install required packages on the OS
1. Install GitLab Omnibus (EE)
1. Configure the `gitlab.rb` file depending on the machine
1. Run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`

In some Roles there are extra steps depending on the components being setup, for example detecting the Primary Postgres node and these can be viewed in the Tasks files for each Role.

### Inventory and Groups

Ansible knows what Playbooks to run on what machines thanks to its [Inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html), which is a list of all target machine addresses available to Ansible. These machines can have labels that help Ansible select and filter through them, which the Toolkit uses extensively.

The Toolkit generally uses a variant of Inventories called [Dynamic Inventories](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html). These Inventories poll the target host provider for the current list of hosts based on several factors. With these you don't need to maintain a static Inventory file.

While with the Inventory Ansible can get a full list of hosts it's to configure it doesn't know what each one is specifically. With [Groups](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#inventory-basics-formats-hosts-and-groups) Ansible can differentiate between the hosts and run the correct Playbooks against them. This is a crucial part to how Ansible runs. With Terraform we called out that we set various labels on the provisioned VMs based on their role. Ansible can read these labels and set up groups based on them, e.g. `gitlab_rails`, `postgres`, etc...

### Variables

[Variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html) are a versatile and integral part of Ansible and can be [defined in many locations](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#understanding-variable-precedence). Ansible itself also collects [many variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html) about the hosts it connects to such as IPs, machine specs and more.

The Toolkit uses these extensively to dynamically configure each GitLab machine depending on its type. This includes things such as selecting what and how to install, finding out IPs of other machines, etc... 

As mentioned there are various ways variables can be configured. The Toolkit uses the following locations for variables (in order of precedence):

- Role Defaults (`role/default/main.yml`) - Contains default variables specific to the Role, e.g. Postgres specific settings. These can be overridden.
- Inventory File vars - Contains variables specific to the environment. Can contain overrides for Role Defaults.
- Group Vars - Variables that are shared between Roles. Most variables can be found here such as IP lists, etc...
- Environment Variables - The Playbooks have been configured to use certain env vars if available.

It's worth noting the Toolkit tweaks the default group variable precedence to better allow for different configurations per environment's inventory. Inventory group variables take a higher precedence here than playbook ones.

Hopefully with this overview it's clearer how Ansible in the Toolkit works. Below we detail how to setup and use it.

## 1. Install Ansible

The Toolkit requires Ansible to be installed and this can be done as desired. Unlike Terraform, there's no general dependencies on Ansible's versions so the latest version should suffice (although your mileage may vary). At the time of writing the Toolkit is confirmed to work with the latest version of Ansible - `2.10.x`.

Since there are no version considerations we recommend just installing Ansible as per the official [Ansible Install Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html). Note that Ansible requires Python 3 and you may need to install it and its package manager `pip3` separately.

In addition to the above, Ansible also requires some dependencies to be installed. You'll need to install Python package dependencies on the machine along with some community roles from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/home) that allow for convenient deployment of some third party applications.

To do this you only have to run the following before proceeding:

1. `cd` to the `ansible/` directory
1. First install the Python packages via `pip3 install -r requirements/ansible-python-packages.txt`.
1. Next, run the following command to install the roles - `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements/ansible-galaxy-requirements.yml`
1. Note that if you're on a Mac OS machine you also need to install `gnu-tar` - `brew install gnu-tar`

## 2. Setup the Environment's Dynamic Inventory

One of the first pieces of config you will need to configure is the Inventory. As mentioned we use Dynamic Inventories as it automates the collection of machines and labels.

The recommend place to store these is in a new folder under [`ansible/inventories`](../ansible/inventories).

Each Dynamic Inventory is a plugin offered by Ansible themselves and are different depending on the host provider. As such, select the section for your host provider and move onto the next step.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

The Google Dynamic Inventory plugin is called [`gcp_compute`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/google/cloud/gcp_compute_inventory.html). This will have been installed already during the Ansible install process via `ansible-galaxy install`.

The config file for this plugin which requires the naming convention `*.gcp.yml`, e.g. `10k.gcp.yml`. Here's an example of the file with all config and descriptions below. Items in `<>` brackets need to be replaced with your config:

```yaml
plugin: gcp_compute
projects:
  - <gcp_project_id>
filters:
  - labels.gitlab_node_prefix = <prefix> # Same prefix set in Terraform
keyed_groups:
  - key: labels.gitlab_node_type
    separator: ''
  - key: labels.gitlab_node_level
    separator: ''
scopes:
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute
hostnames:
  # List host by name instead of the default public ip
  - name
compose:
  # Set an inventory parameter to use the Public IP address to connect to the host
  # For Private ip use "networkInterfaces[0].networkIP"
  ansible_host: networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP
```

- `plugin` - The name of the Dynamic Inventory plugin. Must always be `gcp_compute`.
- `projects` - The ID of the GCP project for the environment
- `filters` - A label filter for Ansible to use. This ensures it only configures the machines we want on the project and not any others based on the machine label `gitlab_node_prefix` set automatically in Terraform. Should be set the same `prefix` value set in Terraform.
- `keyed_groups` - Configures Ansible to look for the labels automatically set by Terraform and to set up it's host groups based on them. This config block shouldn't be changed from what's shown.
- `scopes` - A GCP specific setting for how to use its API. Should not be changed.
- `hostnames` - Config block for how Ansible should show the hosts in its output. This block configures the use of hostnames rather than IPs for better readability. This config block should not be changed.
- `compose`: As shown in the comment this sets what IPs Ansible should use. This config block shouldn't be changed unless private IPs are desired as mentioned in the comment.

#### Configure Authentication (GCP)

Finally the last thing to configure is authentication. This is required so Ansible can access GCP to build its dynamic inventory.

Ansible provides several ways to authenticate with [GCP](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/google/cloud/gcp_compute_inventory.html#parameters), you can select any method that as desired.

All of the methods given involve the Service Account file you generated previously. We've found the authentication methods that work best with the Toolkit in terms of ease of use are as follows:

- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` environment variable - Particularly useful with CI pipelines, the variable should be set to the local path of the Service Account file.
  - Note that the `GCP_AUTH_KIND` variable also needs to be set to `serviceaccount` for this authentication method.
- `gcloud` login - Authentication can also occur automatically through the [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default) command line tool. Make sure the user that's logged in has access to the Project.
  - Note that the `GCP_AUTH_KIND` variable also needs to be set to `application` for this authentication method.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

The AWS Dynamic Inventory plugin is called [`aws_ec2`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/aws_ec2_inventory.html). This will have been installed already during the Ansible install process via `ansible-galaxy install`.

The config file for this plugin which requires the naming convention `*.aws_ec2.yml`, e.g. `10k.aws_ec2.yml`. Here's an example of the file with all config and descriptions below. Items in `<>` brackets need to be replaced with your config:

```yaml
plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
filters:
  tag:gitlab_node_prefix: <prefix> # Same prefix set in Terraform
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.gitlab_node_type
    separator: ''
  - key: tags.gitlab_node_level
    separator: ''
hostnames:
  # List host by name instead of the default public ip
  - tag:Name
compose:
  # Use the public IP address to connect to the host
  # (note: this does not modify inventory_hostname, which is set via I(hostnames))
  ansible_host: public_ip_address
```

- `plugin` - The name of the Dynamic Inventory plugin. Must always be `aws_ec2`.
- `regions` - AWS region the environment will run in.
- `filters` - A label filter for Ansible to use. This ensures it only configures the machines we want on the project and not any others based on the machine tab `gitlab_node_prefix` that set automatically in Terraform. Should be set the same `prefix` value set in Terraform.
- `keyed_groups` - Configures Ansible to look for the tags automatically set by Terraform and to set up it's host groups based on them. This config block shouldn't be changed from what's shown.
- `hostnames` - Config block for how Ansible should show the hosts in its output. This block configures the use of hostnames rather than IPs for better readability. This config block should not be changed.
- `compose`: As shown in the comment this set what IPs Ansible should use. This config block shouldn't be changed unless private IPs are desired as mentioned in the comment.

#### Configure Authentication (AWS)

Finally the last thing to configure is authentication. This is required so Ansible can access AWS to build its dynamic inventory.

Ansible provides several ways to authenticate with [AWS](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/aws_ec2_inventory.html#id3), you can select any method that as desired.

All of the methods given involve the AWS Access Key you generated previously. We've found that the easiest and secure way to do this is with the official [environment variables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#environment-variables):

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Set to the AWS Access Key.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Set to the AWS Secret Key.

Once the two variables are either set locally or in your CI pipeline Ansible will be able to fully authenticate for both the provider and backend.

## 3. Setup the Environment's config

Next we need to configure various Environment specific variables that Ansible will use when configuring GitLab. This is done by setting Inventory variables in separate files alongside the dynamic inventory to ensure the variables are used only for the specific environment.

The structure of these files are flexible, ansible will merge all YAML files that are saved beside the Dynamic Inventory file. For the Toolkit, we use the following files:

- `vars.yml` - Contains all main config specific to the environment such as connection details, component settings, passwords, etc...

### Environment config - `vars.yml`

Starting with the main environment config file, `vars.yml`, which should be saved alongside the Dynamic Inventory file.

Here's an example of the file with all standard config and descriptions below. Items in `<>` brackets need to be replaced with your config. It's worth noting that this is config for a standard install and further variables may be required for more advanced deployments, where applicable we detail these under the relevant section in our [Advanced docs sections](environment_advanced.md). 

```yml
all:
  vars:
    # Ansible Settings
    ansible_user: "<ssh_username>"
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: "<private_ssh_key_path>"

    # Cloud Settings, available options: gcp, aws
    cloud_provider: "gcp"

    # GCP only settings
    gcp_project: "<gcp_project_id>"
    gcp_service_account_host_file: "<gcp_service_account_host_file_path>"

    # AWS only settings
    aws_region: "<aws_region>"

    # General Settings
    prefix: "<environment_prefix>"
    external_url: "<external_url>"
    gitlab_license_file: "<gitlab_license_file_path>"

    # Component Settings
    patroni_remove_data_directory_on_rewind_failure: false
    patroni_remove_data_directory_on_diverged_timelines: false

    # Object Storage Settings
    gitlab_object_storage_artifacts_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-artifacts"
    gitlab_object_storage_backups_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-backups"
    gitlab_object_storage_dependency_proxy_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-dependency-proxy"
    gitlab_object_storage_external_diffs_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-mr-diffs"
    gitlab_object_storage_lfs_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-lfs"
    gitlab_object_storage_packages_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-packages"
    gitlab_object_storage_terraform_state_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-terraform-state"
    gitlab_object_storage_uploads_bucket: "{{ prefix }}-uploads"

    # Passwords / Secrets
    gitlab_root_password: '<gitlab_root_password>'
    grafana_password: '<grafana_password>'
    postgres_password: '<postgres_password>'
    consul_database_password: '<consul_database_password>'
    gitaly_token: '<gitaly_token>'
    pgbouncer_password: '<pgbouncer_password>'
    redis_password: '<redis_password>'
    praefect_external_token: '<praefect_external_token>'
    praefect_internal_token: '<praefect_internal_token>'
    praefect_postgres_password: '<praefect_postgres_password>'
```

Ansible Settings are specific config for Ansible to be able to connect to the machines:

- `ansible_user` - The SSH username that Ansible should use to SSH into the machines with. Previously created in the `Setup SSH Authentication` step ([GCP](environment_prep.md#4-setup-ssh-authentication-ssh-os-login-for-gcp-service-account), [AWS](environment_prep.md#2-setup-ssh-authentication-aws)).
- `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` - Path to the private SSH key file. Previously created in the `Setup SSH Authentication` step ([GCP](environment_prep.md#4-setup-ssh-authentication-ssh-os-login-for-gcp-service-account), [AWS](environment_prep.md#2-setup-ssh-authentication-aws))

Cloud settings are specific config relating to the cloud provider is running on. They're used primarily for the parts of the environment that require direct configuration on the provider, e.g. Object Storage.

- `cloud_provider` - Toolkit specific variable, used to dynamically configure cloud provider specific areas such as Object Storage. Should be set to `gcp`, `aws` or `azure`.
- `gcp_project` **_GCP only_** - ID of the GCP project. Note this must be the Project's unique ID and not just the name
- `gcp_service_account_host_file` **_GCP only_** - Local path to the Service Account file. This is the same one created in [Setup Provider Authentication - Service Account](environment_prep.md#3-setup-provider-authentication-gcp-service-account). The Toolkit uses this to configure GitLab's Object Storage access.
- `aws_region`  **_AWS only_** - AWS region the environment will run in.

General settings are config used across the playbooks to configure GitLab:

- `prefix` - The configured prefix for the environment as set in Terraform.
- `external_url` - External URL that will be the main address for the environment. This can be a DNS hostname you've configured to point to the IP you created on the `Create Static External IP` step ([GCP](environment_prep.md#6-create-static-external-ip-gcp), [AWS](environment_prep.md#4-create-static-external-ip-aws-elastic-ip-allocation)) step or the IP itself in URL form, e.g. `http://1.2.3.4`.
- `gitlab_license_file` - Local path to a valid GitLab License file. Toolkit will upload the license to the environment. Note that this is an optional setting.

Component settings are specific component for GitLab components, e.g. Postgres:

- `patroni_remove_data_directory_on_rewind_failure` - A specific Patroni flag that enables resetting of database data on a secondary node if attempts to sync with the primary can't be achieved. **This may lead to data loss**, refer to the [GitLab Postgres documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#customizing-patroni-failover-behavior) for further info.
- `patroni_remove_data_directory_on_rewind_failure` - A specific Patroni flag that enables resetting of database data on a secondary node if timelines have diverged with the primary. **This may lead to data loss**, refer to the [GitLab Postgres documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#customizing-patroni-failover-behavior) for further info.

Object Storage settings configure GitLab on what Object Storage Buckets to use per data type

- `gitlab_object_storage_*_bucket` - The name of the Object Storage bucket for the specific data type. When used in conjunction with the Terraform `object_storage_buckets` setting each data type bucket will have the naming convention `<prefix>-<datatype>`. If using custom Object Storage buckets then set these accordingly but note that for GitLab it's recommended each data type has a separate bucket.

Passwords and Secrets settings are what they suggest - all of the various passwords and secrets that GitLab requires to be configured by the user.

- `gitlab_root_password` - Sets the password for the root user on first installation.
- `grafana_password` - Sets the password for the [Grafana admin user](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/grafana.html#specifying-an-admin-password) on first installation.
- `postgres_password` - Sets the password for the [GitLab's default Postgres user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#postgresql-information).
- `consul_database_password` - Sets the password for [Consul's database user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#consul-information). Required for Postgres HA.
- `pgbouncer_password` - Sets the password for [GitLab's default PgBouncer user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#pgbouncer-information)
- `redis_password` - Sets the password for [Redis](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/redis/replication_and_failover.html#step-1-configuring-the-primary-redis-instance).
- `gitaly_token` **_Gitaly Sharded only_** - Sets the [shared authentication token for Gitaly](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/#configure-authentication). Only used in [Gitaly Sharded](environment_advanced.md#gitaly-sharded) setups.
- `praefect_external_token` **_Gitaly Cluster only_** - Sets the [external access token for Gitaly Cluster and Praefect](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#secrets).
- `praefect_internal_token` **_Gitaly Cluster only_** - Sets the [internal access token for Gitaly Cluster and Praefect](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#secrets).
- `praefect_postgres_password` **_Gitaly Cluster only_** - Sets the [password for Praefect's database user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#secrets).

Note that this documentation doesn't provide instructions on how to keep these values safe but this is recommended in line with your security requirements.

### Selecting what GitLab version to install

By default the Toolkit will deploy the latest [GitLab EE package](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee) via its repo.

The Toolkit can install other GitLab versions from `13.2.0` onwards through two different methods:

- Repo - A different repo and package can be specified via the two inventory variables `gitlab_repo_script_url` and `gitlab_repo_package` respectively. The Toolkit will first install the repo via the script provided and then install the package.
- Deb file - The Toolkit can install a Debian file directly in several ways:
  - If the package needs to be downloaded from the specific URL you can specify this via the `gitlab_deb_download_url` inventory variable.
    - If the URL to download the deb file requires authorization or other headers you can pass these in a Hash format via the `gitlab_deb_download_url_headers` inventory variable.
  - If the package needs to be uploaded from the local host where Ansible is running, add the `gitlab_deb_host_path` inventory variable that should be set to the local path where the file is located.
  - An additional variable, `gitlab_deb_target_path` configures where Ansible should copy the Debian file onto the targets before installing but this is set to `/tmp` by default and doesn't need to be changed.

### Full config list and further examples

All Ansible config can be viewed directly in the project under the [`group_vars`](../ansible/group_vars) folder. Most config will be found in the [`all.yml`](../ansible/group_vars/all.yml) file, where config applies to all machines. Additional config that only needs to apply to select machines can be found under specific group names under this folder. As mentioned earlier, we may also refer to additional variables in detail later in these docs under the [Advanced sections](environment_advanced.md) where they are applicable.

The Quality team actively uses the Toolkit daily to build and test various environments, including at least one of each Reference Architecture size. These are stored on a different project and can be viewed [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit-configs/quality) for further reference (although note some files are encrypted to protect secrets).

## 3. Configure

After the config has been setup you're now ready to configure the environment. This is done as follows:

1. `cd` to the `ansible/` directory if not already there.
1. Run `ansible-playbook` with the intended environment's inventory against the `all.yml` playbook - `ansible-playbook -i inventories/10k all.yml`
    - Note that we pass the whole inventory folder - `inventories/10k`. This ensures Ansible reads all the files in the directory.
    - If you only want to run a specific playbook & role against the respective VMs you can switch out `all.yml` and replace it with the intended playbook, e.g. `gitlab-rails.yml`

### Running with ansible-deployer (optional)

An alternative way to run the playbooks is with the `ansible-deployer` script. This script will run multiple playbooks in parallel where possible while maintaining the required run order. The script can either run all the playbooks by default or a custom list as passed via the `-p` flag. It should be noted that due to the script running tasks in parallel, if any issues arise during setup then the playbooks would be better run sequentially via the [Using ansible-playbook](using-ansible-playbook) steps to help debug the problem(s).

The script can be run as follows:

1. `cd` to the `ansible/` directory if not already there.
1. Run `ansible-deployer` with the intended environment's just the same as `ansible-playbook` - `./bin/ansible-deployer -i inventories/10k all.yml`

Due to running multiple commands in parallel the stdout of the ansible runner can get very messy, to alleviate this issue the stdout is suppressed and each playbook will create its own log file in `logs`.

## Next Steps

With the above steps completed you should now have a running environment. Head to the external address you've configured to check.

Along with the main environment there are several other services that should be automatically accessible:

- Grafana - `http://<external_ip_or_url>/-/grafana`
- Prometheus - `http://<external_ip_or_url>:9090`
- HAProxy stats - `http://<external_ip_or_url>:1936`
