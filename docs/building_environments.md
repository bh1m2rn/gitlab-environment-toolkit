# Building environment(s)

* [GitLab Performance Environment Builder - Preparing the toolkit](prep_toolkit.md)
* [**GitLab Performance Environment Builder - Building environments**](building_environments.md)

With the [toolkit prepared](prep_toolkit.md) you can proceed to building environment(s). Environments are built in two stages: [Provisioning infrastructure via Terraform](#provisioning-environments-infrastructure-with-terraform) and then [Configuring GitLab via Ansible](#configuring-gitlab-on-environments-with-ansible).

[[_TOC_]]

## Provisioning Environment(s) Infrastructure with Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) provisions the Environment's infrastructure. It works in a unique way where each project should have its own folder and State.

1. Create the environment's Terraform directory and scripts if they don't already exist under `terraform/`. For convenience you should copy one of the existing projects and update the authentication details in the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files to match the new GCP project.
1. `cd` to the environment's directory under `terraform/`. For this example we'll select the 10k environment - `cd terraform/10k`
1. On the intended GCP project create a Storage Bucket for storing the Terraform state if you haven't already. You can name this as you please but the name then needs to be set in the environment's `main.tf` as a backend setting. For example here is the 10k environment's [main.tf](terraform/10k/main.tf) file with backend config.
1. In the environment's Terraform directory (e.g. `terraform/10k`), start by [initializing](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) the environment's Terraform scripts with `terraform init`.
1. You can next optionally run `terraform plan` to view the current state of the environment and what will be changed if you proceed to apply.
1. To apply any changes run `terraform apply` and select yes
    * **Warning - running this command will likely apply changes to shared infrastructure. Only run this command if you have permission to do so.**

## Configuring GitLab on Environment(s) with Ansible

[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) configures GitLab on an Environment's infrastructure.

This is achieved through getting VM info via the [`gcp_compute` Dynamic Inventory source](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory/gcp_compute.html) and then running Ansible Playbooks & Roles against each depending on the VM Labels set via Terraform. Unlike Terraform Ansible doesn't require separate folders per Environment but does require a small config directory for each under `ansible/inventories/`

Playbooks & Roles are structured to cover GitLab nodes respectively. E.G. There are playbooks for `gitlab-rails`, `gitaly`, etc... You can see the current list under `ansible/roles/`.

Examples of running Ansible to configure a GitLab instance can be found below.

### Using ansible-playbook

In this example we'll run all playbooks and roles against all nodes via the `all.yml` playbook:

1. `cd` to the `ansible/` directory
1. Create the Environment's inventory config under `ansible/inventories/` if it doesn't exist already. For convenience you should copy one of the existing projects inventories and update all files with the relevant info for the new environment.
1. You then use the `ansible-playbook` command to run the playbook, specifying the intended environment's inventory as well - `ansible-playbook -i inventories/10k all.yml`
    ** If you only want to run a specific playbook & role against the respective VMs you switch out `all.yml` and replace it with the intended playbook, e.g. `gitlab-rails.yml`

### Using bin/ansible-deployer (optional)

The main difference with using the `ansible-deployer` script is that this command will run multiple playbooks in parallel. The script can either run all of the playbooks by default or a custom list as passed via the `-p` flag. It should be noted that due to the script running tasks in parallel, if any issues arise during setup then the playbooks would be better run sequentially via the [Using ansible-playbook](using-ansible-playbook) steps to help debug the problem(s).
To run the script:

1. Create the Environment's inventory config under `ansible/inventories/` if it doesn't exist already. For convenience you should copy one of the existing projects inventories and update all files with the relevant info for the new environment.
1. You then use the `ansible-deployer` command to run the playbook, specifying the intended environment's inventory just the same as `ansible-playbook` - `./bin/ansible-deployer -i 10k`

Due to running multiple commands in parallel the stdout of the ansible runner can get very messy, to alleviate this issue the stdout is suppressed and each playbook will create its own log file in `logs`.
