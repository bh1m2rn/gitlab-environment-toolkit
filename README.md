# GitLab Environment Toolkit

>>>
Requires [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) or above.
Released under the [GitLab EE license](LICENSE).

GETâ€™s journey is only just beginning. Currently it can configure a base GitLab environment based on the Reference Architectures that can be built upon accordingly.

Customers are very welcome to trial and evaluate GET today, however be aware of [key limitations](#missing-features-to-be-aware-of) of the current iteration. For production environments further manual setup will be required based on your specific requirements.

The GitLab Environment Toolkit (`GET`) is a collection of tools with a simple focused purpose - to deploy [GitLab Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) and [GitLab Helm Charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/) at scale as defined by our [Reference Architectures](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures).

Created and maintained by the GitLab Quality Engineering Enablement team, the Toolkit - built with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) - supports provisioning and configuring machines and other related infrastructure respectively with the following features:

- Support for deploying all [Reference Architectures](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures) sizes dynamically from [1k](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/1k_users.html) to [50k](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/50k_users.html).
- Support for deploying Cloud Native Hybrid variants of the Reference Architectures (GCP only at this time).
- GCP, AWS and Azure cloud provider support
- Upgrades
- Release and nightly Omnibus builds support
- Advanced search with Elasticsearch
- Geo support
- Zero Downtime Upgrades support
- Built in Load Balancing and Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) setup
- External SSL termination

By design the Toolkit is meant to be **_one for all_** and aims to deploy an environment that will be a good base that can be tweaked further depending on your requirements.

## How It Works

At a high level the Toolkit is designed to be as straightforward as possible. A high level overview of how it works is as follows:

- Machines are _provisioned_ as per the [Reference Architectures](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures) with Terraform. Part of this provisioning includes adding specific labels / tags to each machine for Ansible to then use to identify.
- Machines are _configured_ with Ansible. Through identifying each machine by its Labels, Ansible will intelligently go through them in the correct install order. On each it will install and configure Omnibus to setup the intended component as required. The Ansible scripts have been designed to handle certain dynamic setups depending on what machines have been provisioned (e.g. an environment without Elasticsearch, or a 2k environment with a smaller amount of nodes). Additional tasks are also performed as required such as setting GitLab config through API or Load Balancer and Monitoring setup.

## Requirements

Note that the Toolkit currently has the following requirements (with related issues to increase support further):

- GitLab version: `13.2.0` and upwards. ([GitLab version support issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues/35)).
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04 ([OS support issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues/43))
  - Note that additionally at this time GET supports clean Ubuntu installs and may work with existing ones but this is not guaranteed at this time.
  - Admin access to the OS is also required by GET to install various dependencies
- Types of environment: The Toolkit is designed to deploy the official GitLab [Reference Architectures](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures) (Standard or Cloud Native Hybrid) as environments.
  - Advanced usage is possible where users can make tweaks to the environments as desired, such as increasing the number of nodes or their specs, but this is generally unrecommended.

## Missing features to be aware of

There are a few key features which are not supported yet, which are important to keep in mind.

- [Cloud-provider services](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues/74), like Postgres (RDS) or object storage (S3)
- GitLab [Registry support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues/25)
- [OmniAuth](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues/123) (SAML, OAuth) configuration support
- [Promotion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/issues/133) of a Geo secondary

Our next release will be [v1.1.0](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5614) and you can view our upcoming work sorted by tentative milestone on [our development board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/gitlab-environment-toolkit/-/boards). Please note that the issues slated for any upcoming release or milestone are subject to change and may not meet the planned timeframes.
