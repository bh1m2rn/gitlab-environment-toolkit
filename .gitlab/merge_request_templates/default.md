  - [ ] Documentation created/updated in the same MR.
  - [ ] If this MR adds an optional configuration - check that all permutations continue to work.
  - [ ] For Terraform changes: setup a previous version environment, then run a `terraform plan` with your new changes and ensure nothing will be destroyed. If anything will be destroyed and this can't be avoided please add a comment to the current MR.
